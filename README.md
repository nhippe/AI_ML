# AI_ML
This application is a document summarization tool that makes use of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to process and summarize text files. It natural language processing (NLP) techniques, employing both SpaCy for basic tasks and the state-of-the-art BART model from Hugging Face's Transformers library for complex, ML-driven summarization. This dual approach allows the application to adaptively handle a range of summarization requirements. The tool is configurable, supporting user-specified parameters such as document paths and summarization lengths (for SpaCy), and it employs intelligent resource management, selecting the most efficient processing unit (GPU or CPU) based on availability. In order to run this code you will need to pip install spacy,transformers and torch.
